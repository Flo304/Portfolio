                Interior Architect and Designer driven by her passion for details and constant curiosity. Problem solving is part of my process of work and also helps me define and create an authentic identity for the project. Always looking to learn and discover new ways of making while being aware of the impact on living beings. Responsibility is part of my design process, as well as questioning our current systems. Through my studies and professional experiences, Iâ€™ve been subject to many different environments and ways of working. Being able to adapt to different skills is one of my strengths.
